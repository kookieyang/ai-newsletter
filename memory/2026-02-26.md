# 2026-02-26 Session Notes

## Webchat Server
- Built yesterday, runs on port 8899
- Start command: `bash /Users/louis/.openclaw/workspace/webchat/start.sh`
- Image rendering confirmed working ✅

## WhatsApp Integration — IN PROGRESS
- Config updated: `channels.whatsapp` added to `openclaw.json` with `allowFrom: ["+8618516131677"]`
- WhatsApp plugin enabled in `plugins.entries`
- Baileys version: 7.0.0-rc.9
- Gateway shows WhatsApp as linked but "can't link device" error on phone when scanning QR

### Issue
- Louis is in China (mainland), phone and Mac are on **different VPNs**
- WhatsApp appears to be blocking device pairing due to VPN IP reputation on the Mac side
- `web.whatsapp.com` is reachable from Mac ✅
- Phone WhatsApp works (sends/receives) ✅

### Next Steps to Try
- Switch Mac VPN to a different server (HK/SG/JP) with cleaner IP
- Or connect phone to same VPN as Mac
- Or try linking from a non-VPN IP (mobile hotspot outside China)
- Resume after lunch

## Other Notes
- Feishu channel getting 429 errors (rate limit on bot info endpoint) — not blocking
- Duplicate feishu plugin warning in logs (cosmetic, non-blocking)
